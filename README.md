An Adventure in the Darkness is a PC demo game where the main character, Sam, uses his imagination to explore and face his greatest fear, the dark. This demo game was developed as a graduation project to evaluate the knowledge and skills of students in the Interactive Technology Engineering in Digital Animation (ITIAD) program.

## Description

In this game, players take control of a girl who must navigate through different scenarios, the first level being the Forest of Colors. Along the way, the protagonist will face various obstacles to advance. The game combines adventure elements, offering an immersive experience for players.
